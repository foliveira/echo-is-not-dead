#Echo Server

[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/echo-is-not-dead.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/echo-is-not-dead/)

This server runs on port 7 and echoes whatever a client sends to it. It is an implementation of [RFC 862](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc862)

##Install

```sh
$ npm install -g echo-is-not-dead
```

##Run

You'll need to run it with elevated privileges since it uses a reserved port.

```sh
$ sudo echo-is-not-dead
```
